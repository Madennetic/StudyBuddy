## Study Buddy - Deltahacks 2025 Project

Welcome to **Study Buddy**, a productivity app designed to make studying more efficient and collaborative! 🎉 

This was our team’s first experience participating in a large-scale hackathon, and we’re thrilled to have joined **Deltahacks 2025**. Initially, we planned to stick to frameworks and programming languages we were familiar with. However, after attending the Swift workshop during the event, we were inspired by the simplicity and elegance of Swift to challenge ourselves and create an iOS app from scratch.

## Achievements

We are proud to share that Study Buddy won:

- 🏆 **DeltaHacks x Swift Student Challenge Winner**
- 🏆 **Best Community Building Hack**

## **About the Project**
As students ourselves, we understand the challenges of balancing multiple courses and making study time effective. With that in mind, we set out to design an app that:
- **Tracks and logs your study hours.**
- **Provides insights through data analysis to optimize your study plans.**
- **Fosters a sense of community by connecting students with their peers.**

Our project incorporates the following key features:

### **Features**
1. **Login Page**  
   Users can enter their name and username, which is then securely stored in our database.

2. **Courses Page**  
   A dedicated space for users to add all their courses for the semester.

3. **Stopwatch Page**  
   A timer tool that allows users to log study hours for specific courses.

4. **Profile Page**  
   Displays a user’s courses and all relevant study session details in one place.

5. **Study Time Analysis**  
   Provides insights on study habits, helping users identify which courses need more attention.

6. **Explore Page** *(In Development)*  
   Future plans include suggesting educational videos tailored to the topics users are studying.

7. **Study Buddies** *(Planned Feature)*  
   A feature to notify friends when a user starts studying, eliminating the need to message them individually and fostering collaborative study sessions.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Swift** and **SwiftUI** using **Xcode Playground**
- Official Swift documentation and resources provided during the hackathon workshop

## **Our Vision**
We believe Study Buddy has the potential to evolve into a comprehensive productivity tool for students everywhere. While we have built the core features during this hackathon, we are excited to expand and refine the app with additional functionality and improvements in the future.

Thank you for checking out our project, and we hope you enjoy using Study Buddy as much as we enjoyed creating it! 🚀
